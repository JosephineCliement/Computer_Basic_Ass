1) Explain Character Generation / Image generation.

        CHARACTER GENERATION -  
1]Usually characters are generated by hardware.
2]We can generate or prepare characters by software also.
3]Letters, numbers, and other characters are often displayed to lable and annote drawing and go give 
instructions and information to the user.
4]We can display letters and numbers in a variety of size,pattern and style.
5]Most of the times characters are builts into the graphics display devices ,usally as hardware but 
sometimes through software.
             
 There are basic three methods:
1.Stroke method
2.Dot matrix or Bitmap method
3.Starbust method
   1. Stroke method -This method uses small line segment to generate a character.
            The small series of line segment are drawn like strokes of a pen to form a character .
  2. Dot matrix -It is also known as bitmap method because in this method characters are represented by
     an array of dots in the matrix form.
  3.Starbust method-In this method a fixed pattern of line is used to generate the character.
    we can use combination of 24 bit line segment.
