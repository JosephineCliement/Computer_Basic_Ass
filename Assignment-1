1) Explain Character Generation / Image generation.
Ans)
        CHARACTER GENERATION -  
1]Usually characters are generated by hardware.
2]We can generate or prepare characters by software also.
3]Letters, numbers, and other characters are often displayed to lable and annote drawing and go give 
instructions and information to the user.
4]We can display letters and numbers in a variety of size,pattern and style.
5]Most of the times characters are builts into the graphics display devices ,usally as hardware but 
sometimes through software.
             
 There are basic three methods:
1.Stroke method
2.Dot matrix or Bitmap method
3.Starbust method
   1. Stroke method -This method uses small line segment to generate a character.
            The small series of line segment are drawn like strokes of a pen to form a character .
  2. Dot matrix -It is also known as bitmap method because in this method characters are represented by
     an array of dots in the matrix form.
  3.Starbust method-In this method a fixed pattern of line is used to generate the character.
    we can use combination of 24 bit line segment.

2) Explain the working of LCD.
Ans)
Meaning:-
A liquid crystal display or LCD draws its definition from its name itself.
It is a combination of two states of matter, the solid and the liquid. LCD uses a liquid crystal to produce a visible image.
Liquid crystal displays are super-thin technology display screens that are generally used in laptop computer screens, TVs, cell phones, and portable video games.
LCDâ€™s technologies allow displays to be much thinner when compared to a cathode ray tube (CRT) technology.
Working:-
The principle behind the LCDs is that when an electrical current is applied to the liquid crystal molecule, the molecule tends to untwist.
This causes the angle of light which is passing through the molecule of the polarized glass and also causes a change in the angle of the top polarizing filter.
As a result, a little light is allowed to pass the polarized glass through a particular area of the LCD.

Thus that particular area will become dark compared to others. The LCD works on the principle of blocking light.
While constructing the LCDs, a reflected mirror is arranged at the back.
An electrode plane is made of indium-tin-oxide which is kept on top and a polarized glass with a polarizing film is also added on the bottom of the device.
The complete region of the LCD has to be enclosed by a common electrode and above it should be the liquid crystal matter.

3) What is Firmware.Discuss

4) Difference between Hard disk, RAM and Cache

5) Discuss different Levels of  Computer language

6) Create a flowchart for following steps:
      Take 5 marks.
      Calculate average.
      check if average >60 then print Pass otherwise print Fail
      end
